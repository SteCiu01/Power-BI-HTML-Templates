# HTML Waterfall Visual

Interactive IBCS-style waterfall chart for Power BI built entirely in DAX as an HTML measure. Displays year-over-year variance breakdown by quarter or month (switchable via button), with hover tooltips, color-coded positive/negative bars, and dynamic K/M/B formatting. Supports dual-metric toggling (Revenue vs. Quantity) through a slicer-connected measure selector.

*Disclaimer: during the creation of these cards I relied heavily on GitHub Copilot used in VS Code, to manupulate the .pbip files and do some "heavy lifting" such as: repetitive code continuation after setting the standard, deep code commenting, bulk operations.*
