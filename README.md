# Power BI HTML Visual Templates

Collection of Power BI HTML templates for custom visuals, using HTML Content visual.

## Intro

By leveraging the HTML Content visual, it is possible to create reusable, HTML templates built with a mix of DAX and HTML/CSS. These templates can be easily reused across different reports with only a few simple setup steps, and small amendments within each code.

Before deep diving into these templates, let's get the proper visual for using them.

Step 1: in Power BI Desktop, click on "Get more visuals".
