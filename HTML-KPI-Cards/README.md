# HTML KPI Cards

Collection of DAX-HTML-CSS custom KPI cards. 

*Disclaimer: during the creation of these cards I relied heavily on GitHub Copilot used in VS Code, to manupulate the .pbip files and do some "heavy lifting" such as: repetitive code continuation after setting the standard, deep code commenting, bulk operations.* 

## What is currently available?

**1 - Two Metrics KPI Cards with Tabular Details (Quarterly and Monthly)**

This visual is directly linked to two metrics (Total Sales $ and Total Quantity Sold), it displays a "Current" value, vs. a "Previous Period / Comparison" value. It has Quarterly and Monthly views, and with a click it is possible to display details for each quarter/month in a tabular format.

This visual is linked to the standardized measures for measures selector [Actual] and [SPLY], so it is possible dynamically switch between Total Sales $ and Total Quantity Sold. It displays a "Current" value, vs. a "Previous Period / Comparison" value. It has Quarterly and Monthly views, and with a click it is possible to display details for each quarter/month in a tabular format.
